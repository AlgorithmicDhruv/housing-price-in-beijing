# Housing Price Analysis in Beijing

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of housing prices in Beijing from 2011 to 2017. The dataset, sourced from [Lianjia.com](https://www.lianjia.com), undergoes extensive cleaning and filtering, culminating in the creation of a predictive model using a Random Forest algorithm.

## Data Files

- **new.csv**: Original dataset containing raw housing price data.
- **cleaned.csv**: Dataset post-initial cleaning, including handling missing values and translating Chinese characters.
- **filtered.csv**: Final dataset after feature selection, used for training the predictive model.

## Project Workflow

### Step 1: Data Collection

The raw data, encoded in `GB2312`, was read and loaded into a DataFrame for processing.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning

1. **Encoding Detection**: The file encoding was identified using the `chardet` library.
2. **Column Removal**: Unnecessary columns such as `url`, `id`, and `communityId (Cid)` were removed.
3. **Handling Chinese Characters**: Translated and parsed Chinese characters in columns like `livingRoom`, `drawingRoom`, and `floor`.
4. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - `DOM` (Days on Market): Filled missing values with the median.
   - `buildingType`: Filled missing values with the median.
   - `constructionTime`: Filled missing values with the most frequent value.
5. **Data Type Adjustment**: Ensured all columns had appropriate data types.

### Step 3: Data Filtering and Feature Selection

The cleaned dataset was further refined to focus on the most relevant features:
- Selected features: `totalPrice`, `square`, `livingRoom`, `floor`.

### Step 4: Model Creation

A Random Forest model was developed using the `filtered.csv` dataset:
1. **Feature Selection**: Chose four key features for model input.
2. **Model Training**: Trained a Random Forest model with 10 estimators.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² to ensure optimal performance.

### Step 5: Model Export

The trained Random Forest model was exported using `pickle` for future use.
